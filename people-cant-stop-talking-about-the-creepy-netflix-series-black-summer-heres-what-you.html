The new horror show has quite a few layers and it's certainly about a lot more than survival.</p><p>Here's everything you need to know before you watch the Netflix original series <a href=# id=242b4104-844e-3234-a8a9-5e45b5d2d295>"Black Summer."</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>The eight-episode series is set during the dark, early days of a zombie apocalypse</h3></p><p>Per the <a href=# id=70dacb9a-f8f1-38a7-a108-65dac9d4965a>Netflix trailer</a> for season one of the show, "Black Summer" follows the story of a group of strangers. The group includes a mother, played by Jaime King, who is looking for her daughter who she's been separated from.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>The show stars Jaime King, Justin Chu Cary, Christine Lee, Sal Velez, Jr., and Kelsey Flower</h3></p><p>Jaime King, who plays the leading character Rose, has appeared in a variety of films and TV series including "Ocean's Eight," "White Chicks," and "Hart of Dixie."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a href=# id=03282ca1-0376-3324-a570-fac7c5d85960>Justin Chu Cary,</a> who plays Spears, has had a few appearances on TV shows like "We Are Fathers" and "Days of Our Lives."</p><p><a href=# id=5d66e24c-2470-3201-a3a0-d534c6fb1060>Sal Velez Jr</a> ., who plays William Velez, has had minor roles on TV shows like " <a href=# id=33aaa308-4de2-3e74-ae92-cc2de5e5d052>Ray</a> Donovan" and "Ten Days in the Valley."</p><p>Prior to playing Kyungsun, <a href=# id=0401ba38-fcdc-3393-a7ee-d0111b48e8af>Christine Lee</a> had minor roles in a few miniseries and shorts. <a href=# id=43ed2a8d-8238-3d14-a7ba-819305dcb0e2>Kelsey Flower</a> , who plays Lance, also had a few small roles in TV movies and miniseries prior to his role on "Black Summer."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>Black Summer may seem like just another zombie series but Jaime King said there are deeper themes to be found within</h3></p><p>"It's really a refugee story. It's a story of a country and a sickness, and the sickness really has all this symbolism in it. This sickness that people are getting is symbolic of the hatred and the division in our country," <a href=# id=a41c3aa9-b35e-3b7e-ac8e-89e3d12d20fe>King told ScreenRant earlier this year.</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"What I loved about the script is that immediately when I read it, I couldn't breathe. It felt like I was reading something that would happen on the news in real life," King said in an <a href=# id=88bb792f-6750-3ac5-af20-c2ba8f7ba1cd>interview with ComicBook.com.</a></p><p>"When I read the scene when I get ripped away from my child, I was like, 'Oh my God.' And it was happening right when kids were <a href=# id=a06f987f-5b5c-3870-ab31-b7d77b30d635>getting separated from their parents at the border</a> ," she continued. "There are all of these very strong and clear symbolic tie-ins in our script, in all of them, that were deeply personal to what's going on in the world right now."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>Famed horror author Stephen King is a fan of the series</h3></p><p>No, although they share a surname, he's not a relative of the show's lead Jaime King which makes modern horror master Stephen King's tweeting about the series even more significant.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Just when you think there's no more scare left in zombies, THIS comes along. Existential hell in the suburbs, stripped to the bone," the <a href=# id=256843ad-1a31-3e5e-a029-09f23149cd6a>author</a> tweeted.</p><p>"No long, fraught discussions. No endless flashbacks, because there's no back story. No grouchy teens. Dialogue is spare. Much shot with a single handheld camera, very fluid. Showrunners could learn a lot from this," he <a href=# id=6c15fd13-b165-34a4-ad5f-4ee343415a27>wrote in another tweet.</a></p><p>Jaime King re-posted his tweets <a href=# id=ba948c92-90ff-384c-add6-858f1eda78c2>on her Instagram,</a> writing, "That's all, folks. This is what heaven feels like."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>Leading actress Jaime King got busted the f--- up while shooting the finale of the show</h3></p><p>She described one of the show's scenes as "pretty intense" to Entertainment Weekly <a href=# id=aceefd27-47d6-38a9-af75-c36f750a927d>in an interview</a> .</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"When I got injured, we had rehearsed this scene, it's a finale scene, and I have to do something that I've never done before ... ," she told the publication. "I was so shaken by it that I like ran three steps back. They had put a body behind me that they didn't put in rehearsal."</p><p>"The next thing I know, I'm knocked out, and seriously, seriously injured. But of course I get back up and I'm like, 'Just roll cameras, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. We've gotta shoot, we've gotta shoot,'" she continued.</p><p>According to an Instagram that King posted in September, she ended up in the hospital for a few days and was unable to use her hands. In the post, she <a href=# id=977527e3-71dc-3309-af1d-c4b0bbee634b>thanked her medical team</a> as well as the entire cast and crew of "Black Summer."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-28>Many people who worked on the zombie show Z Nation are involved with Black Summer, but the shows are not related</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For example, "Black Summer" co-creator John Hyams <a href=# id=0b07199a-c0d4-3b5e-a39b-77c72598332f>directed several episodes</a> of "Z Nation" and both shows are from the production company <a href=# id=0fd4545b-7a25-3736-a889-cd348dca0eda>The Asylum</a> which also brought the world "Sharknado."</p><p>But this new series isn't a prequel to "Z Nation" and the shows are not connected, as some cast members of "Black Summer" <a href=# id=5dbcca3b-0e86-38a1-a47a-57733974b130>have made clear.</a></p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>Theres no word on a second season yet, but the first one just dropped</h3></p><p>Netflix just began streaming the entirety of season one on April 11 so it's no surprise that there have not yet been talks about a second season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8%2BepqmklWKworrTZqqtp6BiwaK4yqKloGWRl7y2wIytn55lk6eyprzYZqWerJahtrl50p6pop2jYq%2BtrcKkZKytnaKys3nHnqmeq12staLAjLKmrmeqrbl1uJRq</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpeople-cant-stop-talking-about-the-creepy-netflix-series-black-summer-heres-what-you.html&text=People%20can%27t%20stop%20talking%20about%20the%20creepy%20Netflix%20series%20%27Black%20Summer.%27%20Here%27s%20what%20you%20need%20to%20kn&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeople-cant-stop-talking-about-the-creepy-netflix-series-black-summer-heres-what-you.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeople-cant-stop-talking-about-the-creepy-netflix-series-black-summer-heres-what-you.html&title=People%20can%27t%20stop%20talking%20about%20the%20creepy%20Netflix%20series%20%27Black%20Summer.%27%20Here%27s%20what%20you%20need%20to%20kn" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpeople-cant-stop-talking-about-the-creepy-netflix-series-black-summer-heres-what-you.html&title=People%20can%27t%20stop%20talking%20about%20the%20creepy%20Netflix%20series%20%27Black%20Summer.%27%20Here%27s%20what%20you%20need%20to%20kn" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpeople-cant-stop-talking-about-the-creepy-netflix-series-black-summer-heres-what-you.html&title=People%20can%27t%20stop%20talking%20about%20the%20creepy%20Netflix%20series%20%27Black%20Summer.%27%20Here%27s%20what%20you%20need%20to%20kn" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeople-cant-stop-talking-about-the-creepy-netflix-series-black-summer-heres-what-you.html&description=People%20can%27t%20stop%20talking%20about%20the%20creepy%20Netflix%20series%20%27Black%20Summer.%27%20Here%27s%20what%20you%20need%20to%20kn" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rave-and-roses-rema-announces-2022-us-tour-dates-and-venues.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rave &amp;amp; Roses: Rema announces 2022 US tour; dates &amp;amp; venues">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./martin-guerre-1200446178.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Martin Guerre">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
