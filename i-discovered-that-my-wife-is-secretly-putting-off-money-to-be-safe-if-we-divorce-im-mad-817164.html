It’s when the spouses actually don’t cheat on&nbsp;each other and may be&nbsp;the embodiment of&nbsp;faithfulness. But one of&nbsp;the spouses, or&nbsp;both, lie to&nbsp;each other about <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a>, such as&nbsp;hiding debts, or&nbsp;having separate accounts and not telling about this to&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner. Such thing happened to&nbsp;our today’s hero, a&nbsp;man, who’s happily married to&nbsp;the love of&nbsp;his life and is&nbsp;busy with making plans for their bright future. But his wife is&nbsp;acting like she’s preparing for the worst, and is&nbsp;even saving money for this case.</p><p><h2>The man’s family life seems nothing but perfect.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/47e/729/2ff32851ce8a70caffd8caccd3.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man named Jason wrote to&nbsp;us, and all he&nbsp;wanted is&nbsp;to&nbsp;hear some opinions about his complex family situation. He&nbsp;started his story, saying that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;totally satisfied with his <a href=# title="family life" data-link=tag>family life</a>. He&nbsp;and his wife, Joleen, have been happily married for over 10&nbsp;years now. Before tying the knot, they had been dating for over 15&nbsp;years.</p><p>Jason was sure that he&nbsp;knows Joleen, her character, her habits, what she likes and dislikes, what kind of&nbsp;person she&nbsp;is. And he&nbsp;has always been absolutely sure that he&nbsp;and his wife share the solid bond, as&nbsp;their relationship stood the storm of&nbsp;time, and they were through many troubles and challenges together.</p><p>His family has always seemed ideal to&nbsp;Jason, and even when he&nbsp;and Joleen had some hardships and misunderstandings, no&nbsp;one has ever mentioned a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>. So, the man was shocked and surprised to&nbsp;find out that his wife was actually preparing for a&nbsp;possible split and was even saving money for this.</p><p><h2>Jason’s accidental discovery has put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;his trust for his wife.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59c/92f/cfa0875ba7b10d3df35976982c.jpg><p>Jason goes&nbsp;on, saying that he&nbsp;and his wife both work full time and have a&nbsp;combined budget. The man writes that he&nbsp;has never hidden any information about his income and expenses from his wife. He&nbsp;used to&nbsp;think that everything that they&nbsp;do, including the financial planning, was the subject of&nbsp;an&nbsp;open discussion and mutual understanding. But as&nbsp;he&nbsp;confessed later, he&nbsp;was mistaken to&nbsp;even think&nbsp;so.</p><p>The weird behavior of&nbsp;Jason’s wife began when they were just 3&nbsp;years married. The man writes, “Whenever I&nbsp;asked my&nbsp;wife about her income, she started acting aggressively. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;feeling that she was trying to&nbsp;hide something. But at&nbsp;the same time, I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;visible reasons to&nbsp;not trust her or&nbsp;suspect her. So, I&nbsp;left this thought behind and explained it&nbsp;to&nbsp;myself that she just didn’t want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;control her extra-finance that she planned to&nbsp;spend on&nbsp;something for herself only.”</p><p>One day, Jason and his wife were staying at&nbsp;home doing some normal everyday things. There wasn’t even a&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;his wife’s bad mood. She looked and behaved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;usual way, without a&nbsp;sign that something was disturbing her or&nbsp;that she was not satisfied with her life. Joleen went to&nbsp;another room to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;talk with her mom on&nbsp;the phone, and Jason decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;shower in&nbsp;the meantime.</p><p>He&nbsp;then noticed that he’d forgotten to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;towel with him, and left the bathroom to&nbsp;ask his wife where the clean towels were. And at&nbsp;that moment, he&nbsp;accidentally heard her talking to&nbsp;her mom, she was saying something about a&nbsp;divorce, and of&nbsp;course Jason was all ears from then&nbsp;on, trying to&nbsp;figure out what she meant.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;turned out that Jason’s wife had a&nbsp;skeleton in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cupboard.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d0/cb7/a1709b5ef2a82726d9f73cacfa.jpg><p>Jason goes&nbsp;on, saying that what he&nbsp;heard next, was a&nbsp;huge shock for him. Joleen clearly said that she’s putting off some money, and she has some separate bank account where she keeps&nbsp;it. She was offering her mom to&nbsp;take some sum from that account, saying that she doesn’t need it&nbsp;immediately, as&nbsp;she’s saving for a&nbsp;possible divorce with Jason, which is&nbsp;not likely to&nbsp;happen very soon.</p><p>The man revealed that he&nbsp;felt like all his life was a&nbsp;house made from paper bricks, which suddenly started to&nbsp;crush and fall apart after a&nbsp;strong wind. Not only his wife was financially unfaithful to&nbsp;him, she also was literally preparing for a&nbsp;possible divorce somewhere in&nbsp;the future.</p><p>Jason wrote that&nbsp;he, on&nbsp;his end, has never even thought of&nbsp;a&nbsp;divorce, and he&nbsp;was sure that he&nbsp;would live with Joleen till the end of&nbsp;his life. He&nbsp;was planning to&nbsp;have kids together, to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;new house and to&nbsp;change a&nbsp;job which would further allow him to&nbsp;earn more. But at&nbsp;that moment he&nbsp;felt like he&nbsp;was totally deceived, and his frustration was really big.</p><p><h2>Jason’s trust for Joleen is&nbsp;now all gone and the man is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong doubt.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ead/bc3/b4c18d5fde81c5a5f2fbdb7222.jpg><p>Jason admitted that after he&nbsp;found out that his wife was, to&nbsp;some extent, plotting a&nbsp;divorce, he&nbsp;lost trust in&nbsp;everything, including even her faithfulness. He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;knew this was not a&nbsp;right thing to&nbsp;do, but&nbsp;I even started suspecting my&nbsp;wife in&nbsp;cheating on&nbsp;me. This was like a&nbsp;chain reaction: she hid her financial information from&nbsp;me, she was saving money for her own purposes, and she was ready for a&nbsp;divorce. No&nbsp;wonder that&nbsp;I didn’t trust her anymore in&nbsp;other things.”</p><p>The man confessed that he&nbsp;even couldn’t ask her to&nbsp;sit and talk together, because he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was pointless. He&nbsp;now seriously thinks about making a&nbsp;pause in&nbsp;their relationship and living separately for some time. He&nbsp;also admitted that now he’s considering a&nbsp;divorce, too. Jason wrote that he’s not ready for it&nbsp;now, but he&nbsp;believes that without trust no&nbsp;family can exist peacefully, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;supposes that sooner or&nbsp;later their marriage will come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end.</p><p>The man asked&nbsp;us for advice on&nbsp;what he&nbsp;should do&nbsp;and if&nbsp;he’s not overreacting to&nbsp;what his wife has been doing.</p><p><h2>We&nbsp;strongly advise Jason to&nbsp;think things over and to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush with decisions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a84/057/c1699b5f9f9263a9fde94f0c3f.jpg><p>We&nbsp;are thankful to&nbsp;Jason for his trust and for sharing his story with&nbsp;us. Our advice would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;think things over and not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush with drawing any conclusions. Jason’s wife may have some insecurities, and it&nbsp;may occur that she’s simply afraid of&nbsp;losing her family.</p><p>She may not be&nbsp;exactly preparing for divorce, but rather be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;it. This may have pushed her to&nbsp;saving money in&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;lose everything in&nbsp;the end. Also, some women may just be&nbsp;too financially dependent from their spouses, especially if&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband earns more than a&nbsp;wife, and after a&nbsp;childbirth women become even more vulnerable, as&nbsp;they have less time for earning and spend more time on&nbsp;looking after the kids.</p><p>This way or&nbsp;that, we&nbsp;recommend Jason to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;his wife first, even if&nbsp;he&nbsp;thinks it’ll bring no&nbsp;result. He&nbsp;should listen to&nbsp;her arguments and maybe, during a&nbsp;candid conversation, he’ll find out even more about his wife, her fears and hopes, and will understand her better.</p><p>Some people really prefer not to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;each other while having a&nbsp;conflict. And here’s a&nbsp;story about a&nbsp;<a href=#>Japanese couple</a> who didn’t speak a&nbsp;word to&nbsp;each other for 20&nbsp;years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZusMismqiulaeypXnToZitZZ2ueri1xZ5koqtdqLKkvsSto7JloKrBtbXNoGSonpZiurC6xLJkraddl7Juv8CfnGahlmLEpnnDoq2oqpOaeqq5jKaYnWVoZoRygpNo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-discovered-that-my-wife-is-secretly-putting-off-money-to-be-safe-if-we-divorce-im-mad-817164.html&text=Our%20Family%20Is%20Happy%2c%20but%20My%20Wife%20Is%20Secretly%20Saving%20Money%20in%20Case%20We%20Divorce%2c%20Im%20Mad&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-discovered-that-my-wife-is-secretly-putting-off-money-to-be-safe-if-we-divorce-im-mad-817164.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-discovered-that-my-wife-is-secretly-putting-off-money-to-be-safe-if-we-divorce-im-mad-817164.html&title=Our%20Family%20Is%20Happy%2c%20but%20My%20Wife%20Is%20Secretly%20Saving%20Money%20in%20Case%20We%20Divorce%2c%20Im%20Mad" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-discovered-that-my-wife-is-secretly-putting-off-money-to-be-safe-if-we-divorce-im-mad-817164.html&title=Our%20Family%20Is%20Happy%2c%20but%20My%20Wife%20Is%20Secretly%20Saving%20Money%20in%20Case%20We%20Divorce%2c%20Im%20Mad" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-discovered-that-my-wife-is-secretly-putting-off-money-to-be-safe-if-we-divorce-im-mad-817164.html&title=Our%20Family%20Is%20Happy%2c%20but%20My%20Wife%20Is%20Secretly%20Saving%20Money%20in%20Case%20We%20Divorce%2c%20Im%20Mad" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-discovered-that-my-wife-is-secretly-putting-off-money-to-be-safe-if-we-divorce-im-mad-817164.html&description=Our%20Family%20Is%20Happy%2c%20but%20My%20Wife%20Is%20Secretly%20Saving%20Money%20in%20Case%20We%20Divorce%2c%20Im%20Mad" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./russian-actors-tv-film-ukraine-invasion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Difficult Decision Facing Russian TV and Film Actors">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hydroelectricite-les-elus-et-energeticiens-veulent-turbiner-ensemble.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="les lus et nergticiens veulent turbiner ensemble">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
