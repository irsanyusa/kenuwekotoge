During his incarceration, he endured harsh conditions and the constant threat of death.</p><p>His imprisonment and eventual release in 1998, following the death of Abacha, underscored the intense risks he faced during this tumultuous period as he went on to become Nigeria's second democratically elected president in the fourth republic.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>2.

The military government viewed him as a major threat due to his influence in the pro-democracy movement. Despite these dangers, Enahoro remained steadfast in his commitment to the cause, continuing to rally support for the reinstatement of the annulled election and establishing a democratic government.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>3.

She, along with other Nigerian journalists, was accused of being "accessory after the fact of treason."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The lead-up to her arrest dates back to the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential poll by the government of General<strong> Ibrahim Babangida</strong>.</p><p>Anyanwu was one of the few vocal women who critiqued the military juntas with her journalistic piece and civil advocacy against military dictatorship and brutality.</p><p>Not until two years later, Anyanwu was arrested and tried secretly by a military court and sentenced to life imprisonment on July 4, 1995.</p><p>However, in October 1995, her sentence was reduced to 15 years due to pressure from national and international human rights groups.</p><p>Shortly after her imprisonment, Anyanwu was honoured with the International Women's Media Foundation Courage in Journalism Award, drawing global attention.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A note that read, "Some women in America are giving you a prize. The world is watching," was passed to her in solitary confinement.</p><p>Two years later, the Committee to Protect Journalists awarded Anyanwu the CPJ International Press Freedom Award, and in May 1998, she received UNESCO's Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.
