This list of the best jobs for introverts has plenty of ideas for you. Contrary to popular belief, introverts are not just shy people who spend their days hidden away from everyone. There is a broad introversion spectrum and a variety of careers that suit people who fall in each category.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/063bc3a0f86399a5.png><p class=align-left>Good jobs for introverts are those that prioritize independently working in quiet spaces and minimize public speaking. A high paced environment can become frustrating for people who are not outgoing. Introvert jobs that allow one to focus on a single task at a time are ideal.</p><h2>Which are the best jobs for introverts?</h2><p class=align-left>How can an introvert make money? Here are 10 good careers for introverts in various fields:</p><h3>1. Photographer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/474d75fc686a53e7.jpg><p class=align-left>Photography is one of the ideal jobs for antisocial people because it requires minimal interaction with others. If you are a thoughtful loner who sees the world a little differently and takes time to imagine things from a different point of view, you will excel at photography.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1f25ab09393fcd0c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30+ relatable tired meme ideas to exchange with your coworkers</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Being a photographer comes with many perks. You can choose to do wedding photography, portraits, commercial shoots, or studio work. You will have a flexible schedule that allows you to take some time off and recharge yourself after interacting with people.</p><h3>2. Graphic designer</h3><p class=align-left>Creativity is one of the trademarks of most loners. As a graphic designer, you will be required to use visual elements to communicate.</p><p class=align-left>You will work alone on most projects, but you will have to consult your clients from time to time. This aspect of graphic design places it among good jobs for introverts who interact effortlessly with small groups of people.</p><h3>3. Therapist/Counselor</h3><p class=align-left>Critical thinking, empathetic listening, and the ability to see things from more than one perspective are qualities that every therapist needs. These qualities are also very common in loners. They are able to listen keenly and bring out new realizations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e3622b3932720ce4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30+ funny good morning memes to send to your family and friends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since therapists interact with a few people at a time and rarely give presentations in front of an audience, it is one of the best jobs for shy people.</p><h3>4. Writer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1f25ab09393fcd0c.jpg><p class=align-left>If you are looking for entry level jobs for introverts that can be done remotely, writing is a great choice. There is so much variety in this career; you can write creative, educational, or commercial pieces. Poems, books, and articles are a few examples of types of writing.</p><p class=align-left>The best part about a writing career is that it offers on-the-job training. You get to learn as you work and improve your skills. With the growth of the <a id=http://seocontent.xyz/courses/how-to-be-a-content-writer/lessons/cms-content-management-system/ href=# title="Introvert jobs" rel="nofollow noopener">freelance world</a>, writing is quickly becoming one of the most promising careers.</p><h3>5. Researcher</h3><p class=align-left>The best jobs for loners are those that can be done without collaboration. With the right skills, loners make great researchers because they effortlessly spend hours alone digging through books and online databases.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f201313e463a0d71.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best examples of creative hobbies for women</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Being a researcher comes with extra perks, a flexible schedule, and the opportunity to work on projects in your preferred niche. It requires attention to detail, and most timid people have an analytical mindset that would come in handy.</p><h3>6. Translator</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike interpreters who convert a spoken word from one language to another, translators work on written material. Being a translator is one of the best jobs for introverts with anxiety simply because it can be done without any social interaction.</p><p class=align-left>It can also be done freelance, which comes with the added advantage of a flexible schedule.</p><h3>7. Pharmacist</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e3622b3932720ce4.jpg><p class=align-left>Filling out prescriptions, moving stock, and preparing invoices might sound like mundane tasks, but they create one of the most fulfilling introvert careers. Empathetic people who have a hard time socializing will get a lot of satisfaction from caring for sick people who come to have their prescriptions filled out. Pharmacists rarely cater to large groups at a time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e7212f8b1b696e29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Viktor Frankl quotes from Man's Search for Meaning</span></p></a><h3>8. Computer programmer</h3><p class=align-left>All you need to become a programmer is love for numbers and an affinity for working indoors. Programming is one of the best careers for introverts who have an analytical mindset and pay attention to details.</p><p class=align-left>If you opt to go the freelance route, your life as a loner will become much easier. Perhaps the most beneficial aspect of being a computer programmer is the fat paycheck you get to take home every month.</p><h3>9. Librarian</h3><p class=align-left>Most introverts are avid readers. This fits in well with the skill set required to work in a library. From sorting and shelving books to helping people skim through tons of reading material, most of the work in a library is perfect for shy people.</p><p class=align-left>Social introverts who enjoy human interaction as long as there is an occasional break for private time do well as librarians. The best part of this job is that it allows you to help others while also getting some much needed private time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d5305b1399134394.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Motivating wise quotes for every occasion</span></p></a><h3>10. Mechanic</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/98e01233ba453ff3.jpg><p class=align-left>What are the least stressful careers for timid people? Not all loners love being cooped up indoors. For the outgoing type that prefers to work alone, being a mechanic is the perfect job. You can keep busy all day without having to socialize with many people.</p><p class=align-left>Working on technical aspects can be a great outlet for thinkers who spend a lot of time contemplating how things work. If you are such a person, training to fix cars will give your brain a much-needed workout.</p><h2>What kind of introvert are you?</h2><p class=align-left>There are four categories of timid people; social, thinking, anxious, and reserved. Each group has unique characteristics. To get a career that suits you well, you must understand which type of introvert you are.</p><p class=align-left>Many loners have a mixture of traits that cut across the four categories. However, traits from one group tend to dominate and are proof of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> what kind of introvert</a> a person is.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c493115b1ef522a2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fantastic reading quotes to inspire you</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f201313e463a0d71.png><ul><li><strong>Social introverts - </strong>are not averse to social interaction. They are comfortable when interacting with a few people at a time and can engage in conversation. Social situations are not a source of anxiety, but they prefer to be alone.</li><li><strong>Thinking introverts – </strong>handle social interaction quite well. However, they spend this time introspecting and engaging their imagination. Although they are not uncomfortable in social situations, they are often quiet and thoughtful around others.</li><li><strong>Anxious introverts –</strong> are very uncomfortable in social situations. They do not enjoy the company of others. Their anxiety is very pronounced and causes them discomfort even when they spend time alone</li><li><strong>Reserved introverts –</strong> tend to ruminate over everything they do. Before speaking or acting, they will think everything through and end up being slower than most people. They take long to perform tasks that require decisiveness.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The best jobs for introverts exist in all fields. One can opt for a more hands-on occupation fixing cars, or the more laid back alternative of taking pictures of nature. Regardless of the job you chose, it is important to truly understand which type of loner you are. Once you understand this, you will have a fulfilling career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/660ba4bd7933b05e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 gorgeous easy henna designs for everyone!</span></p></a><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR8k3BwcmWSmsC1ecmomaxlmaPBs7vVnqmtq12pvLF5kGlknJmimrKzecidnJqrXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f1304799-best-jobs-introverts-top-10-career-ideas-html.html&text=Best%20jobs%20for%20introverts%3a%20Top%2010%20career%20ideas&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1304799-best-jobs-introverts-top-10-career-ideas-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1304799-best-jobs-introverts-top-10-career-ideas-html.html&title=Best%20jobs%20for%20introverts%3a%20Top%2010%20career%20ideas" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f1304799-best-jobs-introverts-top-10-career-ideas-html.html&title=Best%20jobs%20for%20introverts%3a%20Top%2010%20career%20ideas" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f1304799-best-jobs-introverts-top-10-career-ideas-html.html&title=Best%20jobs%20for%20introverts%3a%20Top%2010%20career%20ideas" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1304799-best-jobs-introverts-top-10-career-ideas-html.html&description=Best%20jobs%20for%20introverts%3a%20Top%2010%20career%20ideas" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./greys-anatomy-station-19-cast-richard-flood-anthony-hill-stefania-spampinato-1234720085.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Greys Anatomy and Station 19 Promote Three Cast Members to Series Regulars">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pour-contre-apprendre-nouvelle-langue.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Apprendre une nouvelle langue : les arguments pour et contre">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
