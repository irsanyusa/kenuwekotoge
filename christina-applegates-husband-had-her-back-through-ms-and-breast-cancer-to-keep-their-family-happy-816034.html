At&nbsp;the ceremony, he&nbsp;sat next to&nbsp;Applegate and was seen wiping away a&nbsp;tear, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very emotional moment.</p><p><h2>Martyn LeNoble and Christina Applegate were friends before they started dating.</h2></p><p>Even though Applegate and LeNoble officially got married in&nbsp;2013, they’ve been friends for much longer. In&nbsp;fact, the actress revealed that LeNoble had been a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her life for 13&nbsp;years as&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend. Their relationship kept getting stronger as&nbsp;time went&nbsp;on. They started dating, and after 2&nbsp;years, they got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>engaged</a> on&nbsp;Valentine’s Day in&nbsp;2010.</p><p>They had a&nbsp;private wedding 3&nbsp;years later at&nbsp;their home in&nbsp;Los Angeles in&nbsp;February 2013. We&nbsp;don’t know many details about their wedding, but we&nbsp;do&nbsp;know that their rings were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>designed</a> by&nbsp;jeweler Neil Lane, and Applegate’s <a href=# title=dress data-link=tag>dress</a> was made by&nbsp;Maria Lucia Hohan.</p><p><h2>They have one child together.</h2></p><p>Just 5&nbsp;months <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>after</a> getting engaged, Applegate and LeNoble had exciting news: <strong>they were expecting their first child together</strong>. Their daughter, Sadie Grace LeNoble, was born on&nbsp;January&nbsp;27, 2011. LeNoble’s musical profession complements the household dynamics. Applegate mentioned how their daughter, Sadie, gets to&nbsp;see her dad playing music with guitars and her mom being playful at&nbsp;home. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> her daughter as&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;both their personalities, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;very independent.</p><p>Although Sadie LeNoble wasn’t in&nbsp;the public eye much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, she started walking the red carpet with her mom as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pre-teen. In&nbsp;January 2023, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attended</a> the 28th annual Critics Choice Awards with Applegate and was also her date for the 2023&nbsp;SAG Awards the following month.

She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a> to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;double mastectomy and surgery to&nbsp;remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes. This diagnosis was especially hard for her because she had seen her mother, Nancy Priddy, go&nbsp;through the same illness years before. Thankfully, Priddy had beaten her cancer, which gave Applegate hope and strength for her own fight.</p><p>During this challenging time, LeNoble was there for Applegate, supporting her with humor. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;don’t think&nbsp;I would have been able to&nbsp;get through any of&nbsp;it&nbsp;without him.” She mentioned how they found ways to&nbsp;laugh, even in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>, making light of&nbsp;the strange things happening to&nbsp;her.</p><p>“I&nbsp;laughed more in&nbsp;the hospital than&nbsp;I ever have in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, making fun of&nbsp;all the weird things that were happening to&nbsp;me.
