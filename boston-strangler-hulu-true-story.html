Why should anyone murder four obscure women. That was what made them so interesting…sisters in anonymity, like all of us.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What role did McLaughlin and Cole play in the case?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Over the course of the nearly two years that the 13 victims, ranging in age from 19 to 85 years old, were killed, McLaughlin and Cole led the charge on the theory that the grisly murders were the work of a single assailant, whom they dubbed the “Boston Strangler.” This was nearly a decade before the term “serial killer” was coined.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first six murders, all of older single women who had seemingly willingly allowed the killer to enter their homes, took place in the summer of 1962. There was then a months-long lull in the killing spree until 20-year-old Sophie Clark was found strangled to death in her apartment that December. The next six victims, murdered between December 1962 and January 1964, varied in age from 19 to 69 years old. The majority were sexually assaulted before being strangled to death.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">McLaughlin and Cole began publishing a series of investigative reports on the killings in January 1963, with the first story bearing the newspaper’s questionably chosen headline of “<a href=# rel=noopener>Two Girl Reporters Analyze Strangler</a>.” This launched a month-long run of nearly 30 articles about the murders, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Smithsonian Magazine</a>. It was at this point in time that McLaughlin and Cole started to come up against significant resistance from authorities who took the stance that the level of detail included in their reporting wasn’t helping the investigation and could inspire copycat crimes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tbs-tp-086640.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As for how accurately Boston Strangler portrays McLaughlin and Cole, Ruskin told <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a> that while parts of the movie are dramatized, he tried his best to create a true-to-life depiction of the two women.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I developed a personal relationship with Loretta and [Jean’s] children. I got to know their families very well, and getting the story right was very important to me,” he said. “So I wanted to convey the spirit of these women in the truest way that I could. That said, in terms of trying to tell a story that spanned several years in a feature film, you obviously have to take some liberties.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who was the Boston Strangler?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In October 1964, 34-year-old Albert DeSalvo (played by David Dastmalchian) was arrested for sexually assaulting a woman after pretending to be a police officer to gain entry into her home. When his photo was published in the papers, several other women came forward to say that he had committed similar assaults against them, a set of attacks that came to be known as the “Green Man” crimes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DeSalvo was sent to await trial at Bridgewater State Hospital, a state facility for the criminally insane, and it was there that he allegedly confessed to his cellmate, George Nassar (played by Greg Vrotos), that he was responsible for the murders associated with the Boston Strangler case. Nassar relayed the confession to his lawyer, famed defense attorney F. Lee Bailey (played by Luke Kirby), who took on DeSalvo as a client when he became the prime suspect in the case.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Keira Knightley Investigates a Serial Killer in the Tense, Absorbing </a><a href=#>Boston Strangler</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even with DeSalvo’s own confession, there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute him for the Boston Strangler murders. In 1967, he was tried on charges related to the “Green Man” crimes and sentenced to life in prison for armed robbery and sexual assault. DeSalvo recanted his confession in prison in 1973 shortly before he was stabbed to death by a fellow inmate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some have suggested that Nassar, who is serving a life sentence for a separate murder conviction, is a more likely suspect than DeSalvo and coached him to confess with promises that his family would be taken care of financially. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>WBZ-TV in 2018</a>, Nassar denied having taken part in the killings and claimed he told Bailey to take on DeSalvo’s case. “We were setting it all up, saying Al you’re going to confess, you’re going to trial, you’re going to do your book, we’re going to take care of your family and he was saying ok, ok, ok,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Boston Strangler posits that another likely suspect was Daniel Marsh (played by Ryan Winkles), a pseudonym given by the movie to an ex-Harvard Student who was also one of DeSalvo’s fellow inmates at Bridgewater and had once dated one of the victims. In the following years, Marsh moved to Ann Arbor, Mich., where a series of similar murders later took place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong><a href=#>Sign up for </a><a href=#>More to the Story</a>, TIME’s weekly entertainment newsletter, to get the context you need for the pop culture you love</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Forty years after DeSalvo’s death, a 2013 DNA analysis ultimately linked him to the murder of Mary Sullivan, the last and youngest of the victims associated with the Boston Strangler case. The question of whether DeSalvo committed the other 12 murders remains unanswered.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the time of the positive DNA identification in 2013, the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times</a> quoted Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley as saying that DeSalvo’s confession had “been the subject of skepticism and controversy from almost the moment it was given.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamZohXV%2FjpumrKyfo3q0wNGapaCklad6qcHLrmStqqWaerTAzquwaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fboston-strangler-hulu-true-story.html&text=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20Hulu%27s%20%27Boston%20Strangler%27%20Movie&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fboston-strangler-hulu-true-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fboston-strangler-hulu-true-story.html&title=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20Hulu%27s%20%27Boston%20Strangler%27%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fboston-strangler-hulu-true-story.html&title=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20Hulu%27s%20%27Boston%20Strangler%27%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fboston-strangler-hulu-true-story.html&title=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20Hulu%27s%20%27Boston%20Strangler%27%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fboston-strangler-hulu-true-story.html&description=The%20True%20Story%20Behind%20Hulu%27s%20%27Boston%20Strangler%27%20Movie" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ube-health-benefits-of-african-or-bush-pear.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ube: Health benefits of African or bush pear">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./seeing-red-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Seeing Red | TIME">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
