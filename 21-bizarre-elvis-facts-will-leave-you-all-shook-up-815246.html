But despite his international fame, Elvis never ventured out of&nbsp;North America. He&nbsp;only sang outside of&nbsp;his home country three times, in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>. It’s rumored it&nbsp;was because of&nbsp;Elvis’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker.</p><p>The Colonel was not an&nbsp;American citizen and was living in&nbsp;the United States without proper documentation. He&nbsp;thought that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;left the country for Elvis’s overseas shows, he&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;re-enter the US. He&nbsp;ultimately convinced Elvis that it&nbsp;was more efficient for his career to&nbsp;have people from all over the world come to&nbsp;see him, rather than travel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/697/1c2/a871e255b197e839937bb56b4f.png><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t the only shady thing Colonel Parker did for Elvis’s career. Years after the King of&nbsp;Rock ’n’ Roll had passed away, it&nbsp;was discovered that Parker was taking half of&nbsp;what Elvis made from his music and film projects. Colonel Parker was however a&nbsp;brilliant marketing mastermind, even figuring out a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make money from people that didn’t like Elvis and his music! Parker went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;design some <i>I&nbsp;Hate Elvis</i> pins, that he&nbsp;could sell to&nbsp;people who didn’t want to&nbsp;buy the<i> pro-Elvis</i> merchandise. The Wall Street Journal reported that by&nbsp;1957, all <i>Elvis</i> merchandise&nbsp;— both pro and con&nbsp;— was estimated at&nbsp;over 22&nbsp;million dollars!</p><p>Born on&nbsp;January&nbsp;8, 1935, the future King of&nbsp;Rock ’n’ Roll had a&nbsp;twin brother that unfortunately did not make it&nbsp;through the complications at&nbsp;birth. Elvis’s mother, Gladys, never had another child and became very attached to&nbsp;her only son. When she also passed away, Elvis was inconsolable. <i>She was always my&nbsp;best girl</i> he&nbsp;mentioned to&nbsp;the press.</p><p>Success didn’t come easy for Elvis, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was turned down when he&nbsp;was 19&nbsp;years old, after an&nbsp;audition. At&nbsp;the time, he&nbsp;was looking to&nbsp;join a&nbsp;gospel quartet called Songfellows, but they turned him down. Things worked out for the best though, as&nbsp;Elvis ended up&nbsp;recording his own songs. The first one he&nbsp;ever recorded was named <i>My&nbsp;Happiness,</i> and it&nbsp;cost him 4$&nbsp;to&nbsp;have it&nbsp;recorded, back in&nbsp;1953. He&nbsp;intended it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift for his mother. Since Elvis’s family didn’t own a&nbsp;record player, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend’s home to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;it. That same record was auctioned in&nbsp;2015 for $300,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bbc/5ec/9e9cf15c229437d1914a48d43f.png><p>Elvis’s 50s flamboyant looks consisted of&nbsp;bubblegum pink blazers, crop tops, and Cuban collars. But some think what may have inspired his looks was in&nbsp;fact a&nbsp;comic book character named Captain Marvel Jr. His collection of&nbsp;comics can still be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the attic of&nbsp;his home. Presley never confirmed&nbsp;it, but many think he&nbsp;borrowed Captain Marvel Jr.’s hairstyle and sideburns. The superhero may have also been the source of&nbsp;the cape-like jumpsuits he&nbsp;often wore on&nbsp;stage. As&nbsp;for his staple jet-black hair, it&nbsp;turns out it&nbsp;wasn’t his natural color. Elvis was blonde! He&nbsp;used shoe polish to&nbsp;maintain his hair color at&nbsp;first. And to&nbsp;also keep him looking young and fresh.</p><p>By&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;was 37&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;had outgrown his shoe polish days and started investing more in&nbsp;his appearance to&nbsp;look as&nbsp;youthful as&nbsp;possible. He&nbsp;started using a&nbsp;dye color that’s still available today named Miss Clairol 51&nbsp;D, in&nbsp;the shade called ’black Velvet’<i>.</i> Elvis even went as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;dyeing his <a href=# title=eyelashes data-link=tag>eyelashes</a>!</p><p>One thing Elvis may have not been great at&nbsp;was eating healthy. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;the most outrageous food combinations. He&nbsp;enjoyed the <i>Fool’s Gold Loaf</i>, which was made out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hollowed loaf, stuffed with peanut butter, jelly, and a&nbsp;whole pound of&nbsp;bacon. The famous <i>Elvis Sandwich</i> was created out of&nbsp;his love for peanut butter, a&nbsp;recipe that his grandmother eventually shared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cookbook. It&nbsp;had two slices of&nbsp;bread, a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;peanut butter, banana slices, and bacon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/454/4de/5f68535a538dc62605ee004372.png><p>Apart from his outstanding musical career, Elvis was a&nbsp;popular film actor too. He&nbsp;began his movie career in&nbsp;1956, by&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;a&nbsp;western called <i>Love Me&nbsp;Tender</i>. <i>Loving You</i> was his second film. In&nbsp;total, Elvis ended up&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;over 31&nbsp;films throughout his career.</p><p>Presley’s famous Memphis house, called Graceland, was one of&nbsp;the first important purchases he&nbsp;made after becoming famous. It&nbsp;cost him $100,000 in&nbsp;1957, a&nbsp;year after he&nbsp;launched his career. He&nbsp;was just 22. He&nbsp;immediately asked his parents to&nbsp;move in&nbsp;with him. Graceland was declared a&nbsp;National Historic Landmark in&nbsp;2006. It’s also the second most-visited house in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, after the White House.</p><p>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;Graceland, Elvis surrounded himself with <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a>. He&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;owning everything from dogs and horses to&nbsp;more unconventional pets like donkeys, and even a&nbsp;monkey! He&nbsp;even trained a&nbsp;mynah bird to&nbsp;repeat words and perform them while Elvis was hanging out with his friends.</p><p>He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;cars too. In&nbsp;1955, he&nbsp;purchased a ’55 Fleetwood Series 60&nbsp;Cadillac, which he&nbsp;gifted to&nbsp;his mother. Problem was, she didn’t have a&nbsp;driver’s license, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;drove it&nbsp;around for her. This unique pink Cadillac can still be&nbsp;seen today at&nbsp;Graceland. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;his life, he&nbsp;had purchased over 100&nbsp;Cadillacs, but most of&nbsp;them were bought as&nbsp;gifts for his family and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b4b/5e8/78183356f2b3341aa5420daef1.png><p>Despite his remarkable vocals, Elvis Presley never wrote any of&nbsp;his songs! Throughout his career, Elvis went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;signed to&nbsp;3&nbsp;different record labels that were tasked with writing his songs. He&nbsp;was given co-writing credits for some of&nbsp;the songs that he&nbsp;has performed though. When it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;singing, Elvis was a&nbsp;trailblazer, having broken many records (pun intended) throughout his life. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;known for the best-selling singles of&nbsp;both the 1950s&nbsp;— <i>Hound Dog/Don’t Be&nbsp;Cruel</i>&nbsp;— and the 1960s&nbsp;— <i>It’s Now or&nbsp;Never</i>.</p><p>His debut album was also the first rock ’n’ roll album to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the Billboard charts in&nbsp;the US. It&nbsp;was also the first million-selling record in&nbsp;this genre since it&nbsp;spent a&nbsp;staggering ten weeks at&nbsp;number one back in&nbsp;1956. He&nbsp;did release at&nbsp;one point an&nbsp;album without a&nbsp;single song on&nbsp;it! It&nbsp;was called <i>Having Fun with Elvis on&nbsp;Stage</i>, and it&nbsp;came out in&nbsp;1974. Weirdly enough, it&nbsp;only had spoken content. The album featured the little speeches Elvis had in&nbsp;between songs during his live shows. Obviously, the album wasn’t a&nbsp;critic’s favorite, some even calling it&nbsp;<i>thoroughly unlistenable</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e2e/4f3/8069145c22801e9d0119c34bdd.png><p>Elvis was known for being extremely generous. One story goes that while doing a&nbsp;show in&nbsp;Miami Beach, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;limo pick him up&nbsp;from a&nbsp;helipad. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;nice conversation with the limo driver and asked him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;owned a&nbsp;car himself. The driver said he&nbsp;didn’t own the limo, he&nbsp;was just working for a&nbsp;company. So, Elvis decided to&nbsp;give the limo they were in&nbsp;to&nbsp;that driver!</p><p>His famous dance moves weren’t calculated: he&nbsp;just had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;nerves. People recall him being so&nbsp;nervous during his first performances that his legs were constantly shaking. Needless to&nbsp;say, the audience went wild over him dancing, especially the ladies, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;incorporate the moves into his routine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cc4/250/10f94e59d5af8ee4825549f479.png><p>Elvis liked watching television so&nbsp;much that we&nbsp;would stare at&nbsp;3&nbsp;different&nbsp;TV sets at&nbsp;the same time. He&nbsp;had different sets installed in&nbsp;his downstairs media room, each with its own news program playing at&nbsp;the same time. He&nbsp;kept all the TVs&nbsp;on, unless his least favorite actor, Robert Goulet made an&nbsp;appearance.</p><p>Elvis disliked Goulet so&nbsp;much that instead of&nbsp;using the knob on&nbsp;the television to&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;off, he&nbsp;destroyed it&nbsp;altogether and replaced it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;new one. Hey, don’t be&nbsp;cruel. Nobody really knows what Elvis’s problem was with Goulet, as&nbsp;they were reported to&nbsp;be&nbsp;friends at&nbsp;one point.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9yecGisZqqopp6prjVoqpmnpGYwbR51qKjpWWcmq63sYyypq5lkaG5br%2FHqKakZaWlenl9lGtrb2c%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f21-bizarre-elvis-facts-will-leave-you-all-shook-up-815246.html&text=21%20Bizarre%20Elvis%20Facts%20Will%20Leave%20You%20All%20Shook%20Up&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f21-bizarre-elvis-facts-will-leave-you-all-shook-up-815246.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f21-bizarre-elvis-facts-will-leave-you-all-shook-up-815246.html&title=21%20Bizarre%20Elvis%20Facts%20Will%20Leave%20You%20All%20Shook%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f21-bizarre-elvis-facts-will-leave-you-all-shook-up-815246.html&title=21%20Bizarre%20Elvis%20Facts%20Will%20Leave%20You%20All%20Shook%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f21-bizarre-elvis-facts-will-leave-you-all-shook-up-815246.html&title=21%20Bizarre%20Elvis%20Facts%20Will%20Leave%20You%20All%20Shook%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f21-bizarre-elvis-facts-will-leave-you-all-shook-up-815246.html&description=21%20Bizarre%20Elvis%20Facts%20Will%20Leave%20You%20All%20Shook%20Up" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-sexual-things-your-woman-likes-but-may-be-too-shy-to-ask.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 sexual things your woman likes but may be too shy to ask">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./high-tide-film-north-america-release-1236088246.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Undocumented Immigrant Film High Tide Set for North American Release (EXCLUSIVE)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
