Because of&nbsp;their elegant looks, you surely couldn’t miss them out on&nbsp;the streets&nbsp;— they also made sure you wouldn’t.</p><p>Full of&nbsp;young men between 12&nbsp;and 30&nbsp;years old, this gang soon became a&nbsp;serious problem for Birmingham police. Their rudeness and mischief were soon the stuff of&nbsp;legends. Years later, the curator of&nbsp;the West Midlands Police Museum, said that they would target anyone who appeared weak or&nbsp;unfit. Anything that could be&nbsp;stolen, they’d take&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/14b/c26/d671a5564598503d4eb49caaae.png><p>Their name? The Peaky Blinders. You might have heard of&nbsp;them because of&nbsp;the famous&nbsp;TV show, but it’s not all fiction. There’s still a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;controversy regarding how they got their name. But for the most part, “peaky” was a&nbsp;word used for any flat cap with a&nbsp;peak. As&nbsp;for the slang term “blinder,” this is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;use today in&nbsp;Birmingham. It&nbsp;was once widely used to&nbsp;show something or&nbsp;someone looking dapper.</p><p>Using the cap to&nbsp;hide their faces from people is&nbsp;another reason why they may have been called the “Peaky Blinders”. They didn’t really want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recognized by&nbsp;the people or&nbsp;the police. These days they’re considered the first modern youth movement. The way they dressed, their sense of&nbsp;style, and their slang, stood at&nbsp;the base of&nbsp;other 20th-century youth movements, like punks for example.</p><p>The Peaky Blinders&nbsp;— and other gangs like it&nbsp;— came to&nbsp;be&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the poor living conditions and economic challenges of&nbsp;industrial England in&nbsp;the late 19th century. They emerged because of&nbsp;how poor people were. Young boys had to&nbsp;pickpocket as&nbsp;a&nbsp;means of&nbsp;income. Uneducated men didn’t have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;career prospects, so&nbsp;stealing and other criminal activity became a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;life.</p><p>The Peaky Blinders became famous for doing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;style, with bell-bottom trousers, pearl buttons, overcoats, silk scarfs, and steel-toed leather boots. They also acted as&nbsp;outrageously as&nbsp;possible. One such story was actually the reason why the creator of&nbsp;Peaky Blinders decided to&nbsp;write the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bd7/95f/e61f5b554baa8c89471f2c5174.png><p>He&nbsp;remembered a&nbsp;little anecdote his dad used to&nbsp;tell, about being sent with a&nbsp;written message to&nbsp;his uncles. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;little boy at&nbsp;the time and remembered knocking at&nbsp;the door and seeing about eight men sitting at&nbsp;the table, all dressed impeccably and wearing those signature caps.</p><p>The most shocking thing of&nbsp;all? The table was covered in&nbsp;<a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a>! Some of&nbsp;their first reported activities were written in&nbsp;a&nbsp;newspaper dating from March 1890. By&nbsp;that time, the group was already becoming famous for their wildness. They were actually happy to&nbsp;have their “performances” recorded in&nbsp;the national newspapers!</p><p>By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1800s, this gang included people of&nbsp;a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;ages, from as&nbsp;young as&nbsp;twelve, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;thirty. The group soon gained organization status through informal hierarchies.<br>Probably the most powerful member of&nbsp;the Peaky Blinders was a&nbsp;man known as&nbsp;Kevin Mooney. That wasn’t his real name though, it&nbsp;was Thomas Gilbert, but he&nbsp;often changed his last name to&nbsp;avoid arrest.</p><p>At&nbsp;the peak of&nbsp;the real-life gang’s power, he&nbsp;was the ringleader. In&nbsp;1899, local authorities tried to&nbsp;control their activity by&nbsp;placing an&nbsp;Irish police constable in&nbsp;Birmingham. The purpose was to&nbsp;gain greater levels of&nbsp;law enforcement in&nbsp;the area. It&nbsp;was unsuccessful though. The Peaky Blinders had already made stable connections with the local police. So, they continued their activities more or&nbsp;less unbothered whilst the police authority became diminished.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/801/dad/a6e09a5746a5c64dd121b50a7d.png><p>But what sets them apart from other gangs? Their sense of&nbsp;style had a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with their popularity because it&nbsp;was effective in&nbsp;many ways. On&nbsp;one hand, it&nbsp;gave them a&nbsp;great deal of&nbsp;attention and set them apart from other gangsters. More&nbsp;so, the way they dressed showed wealth and luxury. They looked unaffordable to&nbsp;other people around them.</p><p>They made sure to&nbsp;extend this look to&nbsp;their family members, which included their wives and girlfriends, who could afford extravagant dresses and coats, unlike other women. Women were equally as&nbsp;involved in&nbsp;these gangs, with evidence of&nbsp;female gang members involved in&nbsp;larger-scale events. Young women would have also dressed themselves to&nbsp;look like gang members, and wore long fringes, colored neckerchiefs, and colored or&nbsp;striped skirts.</p><p>This lavish manner of&nbsp;dressing was also a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;defying the police. Officers could easily recognize a&nbsp;man as&nbsp;being a&nbsp;Peaky Blinder but would remain powerless to&nbsp;their wrongdoings. Most of&nbsp;the time they could hardly even remember the faces of&nbsp;the gang members. As&nbsp;to&nbsp;historical accuracy, there are many differences between the show and the real-life gang. First of&nbsp;all, the timing was different.</p><p>The real Peaky Blinders were mostly active in&nbsp;the 1890s, not the 1920s as&nbsp;portrayed in&nbsp;the show. That’s because they lost power in&nbsp;the 1910s to&nbsp;the rival gang The Birmingham Boys. Their wrongdoings weren’t as&nbsp;sensational as&nbsp;depicted in&nbsp;the show either. A&nbsp;well-known member of&nbsp;the Peaky Blinders named Harry Fowles was arrested for merely stealing a&nbsp;bicycle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/672/5be/8831db5de4a66f33d7ab75e328.png><p>Henry Lightfoot was the first man ever to&nbsp;be&nbsp;called a&nbsp;Peaky Blinder. He&nbsp;lived on&nbsp;Garrison Lane, in&nbsp;Birmingham, England in&nbsp;the late 19th century. There’s little information on&nbsp;Henry Lightfoot’s life, apart from what was recorded by&nbsp;the police and found by&nbsp;the press.</p><p>It’s known that throughout his life he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;caster, molder, metal roller, and painter. He&nbsp;started acting badly when he&nbsp;was about 22&nbsp;years old. It&nbsp;all started with stealing racing pigeons and eventually lead to&nbsp;single-handedly taking on&nbsp;the Hay Mills police and even to&nbsp;a&nbsp;duel with a&nbsp;detective. Towards the end of&nbsp;his life, he&nbsp;stuck to&nbsp;raising his family.</p><p>One of&nbsp;their most famous meeting locations was a&nbsp;pub named The Garrison&nbsp;— which is&nbsp;recreated in&nbsp;the show. It&nbsp;was known as&nbsp;their informal headquarters. In&nbsp;real life though, the building was not as&nbsp;glamorous as&nbsp;seen on&nbsp;TV. The Peaky Blinders were active in&nbsp;Birmingham until about 1910. They were then taken over by&nbsp;a&nbsp;larger gang, called The Birmingham Boys.</p><p>This one was led by&nbsp;a&nbsp;man equally as&nbsp;famous named Billy Kimber. His power extended from Birmingham to&nbsp;the North of&nbsp;England and London between 1910 and 1930. His group was known for bookmaking, bribery, smuggling, and whatsoever. Billy Kimber was, for several years, the biggest gang leader in&nbsp;the UK. After many years of&nbsp;clinging to&nbsp;power, Kimber passed away because of&nbsp;his ill health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/063/88a/bd157b5e49ae201f16518d2d16.png><p>But the story doesn’t stop there, as&nbsp;the gang scene was then taken over by&nbsp;the Sabini clan. Their name came from Charles Sabini, an&nbsp;Italian-English man born in&nbsp;Clerkenwell in&nbsp;1888, whose real name was Ottavio Handley. Dubbed the “King of&nbsp;the Racehorse Gangs”, he&nbsp;dominated London’s underworld for much of&nbsp;the early twentieth century. He&nbsp;oversaw several clubs and had around 100 members in&nbsp;his notorious gang.</p><p>Sabini was also known for his many connections in&nbsp;the police and with the authorities. The increasing dominance of&nbsp;other gangs wasn’t the only thing that led to&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the Peaky Blinders. It&nbsp;started with stricter policing and heavier sentences for the crimes they did. These changes meant that a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people left the gang and fewer replaced them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2b8/73c/e804375ad1b632f4e03e834d36.png><p>Plus, young people began to&nbsp;have more opportunities. They had increasingly more access to&nbsp;education and preferred going to&nbsp;school to&nbsp;secure their futures. They also learned to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disciplined. Boxing clubs gave many an&nbsp;alternative to&nbsp;that gang spirit.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the things that made these people be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gang in&nbsp;the first place was the fact that they felt like they belonged somewhere. So, by&nbsp;the late 1920s, what was left of&nbsp;the Peaky Blinders had relocated to&nbsp;the countryside and mostly disappeared from view of&nbsp;the Sabini clan.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYympqysXajBurjIrJ9mn5GjtG6x1Z6pZqiVlri6ecGloKeclafAbsDRrpxmq6Skv7p5l2pscWhiZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-most-stylish-gang-ever-peaky-blinders-true-story-815802.html&text=The%20Most%20Stylish%20Gang%20Ever%20%7c%7c%20Peaky%20Blinders%20True%20Story&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-most-stylish-gang-ever-peaky-blinders-true-story-815802.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-most-stylish-gang-ever-peaky-blinders-true-story-815802.html&title=The%20Most%20Stylish%20Gang%20Ever%20%7c%7c%20Peaky%20Blinders%20True%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-most-stylish-gang-ever-peaky-blinders-true-story-815802.html&title=The%20Most%20Stylish%20Gang%20Ever%20%7c%7c%20Peaky%20Blinders%20True%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-most-stylish-gang-ever-peaky-blinders-true-story-815802.html&title=The%20Most%20Stylish%20Gang%20Ever%20%7c%7c%20Peaky%20Blinders%20True%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-most-stylish-gang-ever-peaky-blinders-true-story-815802.html&description=The%20Most%20Stylish%20Gang%20Ever%20%7c%7c%20Peaky%20Blinders%20True%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tuc-cheese-cracker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TUC Cheese Cracker popularity &amp;amp; fame">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./se-soigner-en-bougeant-grace-la-maison-sport-sante-de-nogent-sur-seine-10.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Se soigner en bougeant, avec la Maison sport-sant de Nogent-sur-Seine">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
